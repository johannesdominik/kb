# Computer Memory
Memory Hierarchy (accending from small size, small capacity, very fast, very expensive):
* registers (volatile)
* static RAM (volatile)
* dynamic RAM (volatile)
* flash memory (non-volatile)
* magnetic storage (non-volatile)
* optical storage (non-volatile)

Volatile memory is computer memory that requires power to maintain the stored information.
Non-volatile memory is computer memory that can retain the stored information even when not powered.

### Static RAM (SRAM)
Consists of six connected transistors.

Examples:
* processor cache

### Dynamic RAM (DRAM)
Consists of a transistor and a capacitor that stores electrical charges.

Examples:
* RAM

### Flash Memory
* NAND: sequential, more storage, difficult read/write
* NOR: parallel, less storage, easy read/write

Examples:
* USB flash drive
* SD Card
* solid-state drive (SSD)

### Magnetic Storage
Magnetic Storage uses a
magnetization process for data processing like read/write/access 
operations. A magnetic disk have circular platters coated with magnetic 
material. Data is stored in form of tracks, spots and sectors.
The information is accessed using one or more read/write heads.

Examples:
* hard disk drive (HDD)
* floppy disk
* magnetic tape

### Optical Storage
An optical disk stores data using laser light and is read 
using the same. Laser light reads data on a spinning disk.

Examples:
* CD
* CD-ROM
* DVD
* Blu-Ray
