# Basics

# How to run your JavaScript Code
JavaScript can run on every device that has a JavaScript engine.
- in the Chrome Developer Tools Console
- HTML inline with the `<script>` tag (usually before the closing body tag)
- in an external file with `<script src="./some.js"></script>`
- in Node.js by calling the script in the console: `node node-example.js`

# Where to put your JavaScript code

- the HTML standard recommends placing the `<script>` tag within the page head
- if your script is designed to write data to the page, you have to place it within the `<body>` on the exact position where you want the text to appear
- if your script refers to an item on the page, then the script must be placed after that item

â†’ so usually the JavaScript code will be at the end of the body

```html
	...
	<script src="./scripts/myscripts.js"></scripts>
</body>
```

# When your code gets executed

There are three ways:

- automatically when the page loads
- when your script calls a function
- in response to some event, such as the user clicking a button

# Handling browsers with JavaScript turned off

```html
<noscript>
	<p>Hey, your browser has JavaScript turned off!</p>
	<p>Okay, cool, perhaps you'll prefer this <a href="no-js.html">non-JavaScript version</a> of the page.</p>
</noscript>
```

# First Steps

```js
alert('Hello World');
console.log('Hello World');
console.error('This is an error');
console.warn('This is a warning');

if (confirm("Are you sure about this?") === true) {
	console.log("You clicked OK.");
} else {
	console.log("You clicked Cancel.");
}
```

# Writing Text to the Page

```js
document.write("This page was last modified on " + document.lastModified);
document.write("Copyright " + new Date().getFullYear());
```

# Variables

- `var`: function scoped (visible in entire function), should not be used
- `let`: block scoped (only visible in current block e.g. in an if statement), you can reassign values
- `const`: block scoped; can't be reassigned

```js
var first = 'wes'; // variable declaration
let age = 30;
age = 31;

const score = 10;
```

`'use strict';` does not let you define a variable without the specifier; enforced by default when using modules (which is most common in modern JavaScript)

Variables need to be named with letters underscores and dollar signs.

## Rules

- use `const` by default
- use `let` if you want to change the variable
- almost never use `var`
